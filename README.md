- sklearn: Machine learning library for data splitting.
- torch.utils.data: Utilities for working with data loaders and datasets.

# Constants
- LEARNING_RATE: Learning rate for the optimizer.
- BATCH_SIZE: Batch size for training and testing.
- TRAIN_TEST_SPLIT: Percentage of data used for training (vs. testing).
- EMBEDDING_SIZE: Size of embeddings for categorical variables.

# Dataset
- The code loads the "Cardekho India" dataset from an external source if it doesn't exist locally.
- The dataset is preprocessed and divided into training and testing sets.
- Categorical features are embedded using PyTorch's Embedding layers.
- Numerical features are normalized to have zero mean and unit variance.

# Neural Network Model
- The model consists of three embedding layers for categorical features and several fully connected layers.
- Batch normalization is applied for regularization during training.
- The model outputs a single sigmoid-activated neuron for binary classification.

# Loss Function
- The code uses binary cross-entropy loss for training.

# Training Loop
- The model is trained for multiple epochs.
- Training and testing loss, accuracy, and F1-score are monitored.
- The training results are visualized using Matplotlib.
